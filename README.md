# Projects
These are some of the Projects I have developed over the months working with Python. I have created a Triangle Validity Project which determines
if a triangle is valid or not, or a degenerate etc. I have also created a Python representation of a card game called Klondike. The cards.py file is needed
to function the card game as it pulls all the classes from there. I have also made a Mathematics Project that can caulaute the sine of numbers etc.
