# Card Game Project




This Python project brings the classic card game Klondike to life using object-oriented programming (OOP). The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) where players can interact with the virtual deck and tableau. The program utilizes classes like Card, Deck, and Tableau to represent the cards, the deck of cards, and the tableau layout, respectively. Players can drag and drop cards within the tableau, following Klondike's rules such as alternating card colors and stacking cards in descending order by rank. The project also includes functionalities for shuffling and dealing cards, as well as detecting when the game is won or lost. By implementing Klondike in Python with OOP, this project demonstrates the power of abstraction and encapsulation in creating interactive and engaging card games
